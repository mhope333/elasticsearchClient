# elasticsearchClient
#### Testing out elasticsearch client 

Elasticsearch runs at `http://localhost:9200/`
elasticsearchClient.js gets an configures an elasticsearch node.js client

## Running Locally:
- Ensure you have elasticsearch running locally
- Run `npm i` to install node modules
- Running: `node src/operations/updateField.js` inserts a document into elasticsearch and updates a field
- Running: `node src/operations/removeField.js` inserts a document into elasticsearch and removes a field
